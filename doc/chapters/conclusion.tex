In this section we present conclusions, final remarks, and point to directions for future work.

\section{Discussion}

Overall comparison and brief discussion after presenting results.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ironically, when compared to end-to-end learning, most transfer learning experiments actually take longer because of the larger number of parameters that you end up training anyway.
    \item Transfer learning is not such a simple off-the-shelf technique. The network needs to be carefully explored, as was shown by the subpar results of the Inception V3 models.
    \item Extracting all features is the best idea. Optimization does not work in layers but as a whole, so breaking them apart is not a great idea because neurons develop co-dependencies between them.
    \item Performance is too dependent on regularization. Nothing can be concluded from surface.
\end{itemize}
